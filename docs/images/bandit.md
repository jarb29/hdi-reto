# Security Analysis with Bandit

Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. Using Bandit, you can systematically scan your codebase for vulnerabilities and ensure that your code meets security best practices.

## Running Bandit with Configuration in `pyproject.toml`

The recommended way to run Bandit is by defining your configurations in a `pyproject.toml` file. Here's how to do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Bandit**:
   Ensure you have Bandit installed in your development environment:
   ```bash
   pip install bandit
   ```

2. **Create or Update `pyproject.toml`**:
   Ensure you have a `pyproject.toml` file in your project root. If it doesn't exist, create it and add the Bandit configuration:

   ```toml
   [tool.bandit]
   targets = ["."]
   # Add any specific configurations for Bandit here
   ```

   Here is an example configuration for `pyproject.toml` that includes some common Bandit settings:

   ```toml
   [tool.bandit]
   targets = ["."]
   exclude = ["tests/*", "docs/*"]
   tests = ["B101", "B102", "B103"]  # Specify specific tests to run
   ```

   Here's what the example test IDs mean:
    - **B101: assert_used**
        - **Description**: Detects the use of `assert` statements. While useful for development, they should not be used in production code as they can be stripped away when running Python in optimization mode.
        - **More Info**: [Bandit B101](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_asserts.html)
    - **B102: exec_used**
        - **Description**: Detects the use of `exec`. This function allows dynamic execution of Python code, which is risky and can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.
        - **More Info**: [Bandit B102](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b102_exec_used.html)
    - **B103: set_bad_file_permissions**
        - **Description**: Detects insecure use of `chmod` that might set file permissions allowing unauthorized access or modifications.
        - **More Info**: [Bandit B103](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b103_set_bad_file_permissions.html)

3. **Run Bandit with the Configuration**:
   Execute Bandit, pointing it to your configuration file and targeting the current directory (recursively scanning all Python files):
   ```bash
   bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .
   ```

### Breakdown of the Command

- **`bandit`**: The Bandit tool for security analysis.
- **`-c pyproject.toml`**: Specifies the path to the configuration file (`pyproject.toml`). This flag tells Bandit to use the configurations defined in this file.
- **`-r .`**: Recursively scan the current directory (`.`). Bandit will analyze all Python files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.

### Example Output

Running the command might produce output similar to the following:

```plaintext
[main]	INFO	profile include tests: None
[main]	INFO	profile exclude tests: None
[main]	INFO	cli include tests: None
[main]	INFO	cli exclude tests: None
[tester]	INFO	running on Python 3.11.0
[...]
Run started:2023-10-10 xx:xx:xx

Test results:
>> Issue: [B101:assert_used] Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when compiling to optimised byte code.
   Severity: Low   Confidence: High
   Location: path/to/code.py:15

### Summary

Bandit is a valuable tool for maintaining the security of your Python codebase. By leveraging the `pyproject.toml` configuration file, you can customize its behavior to fit your project's needs. Running `bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .` will help identify potential security vulnerabilities in your code so that they can be addressed before they become problematic.
